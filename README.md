# Final Python Portfolio
Five projects that were created in the pygame library in python.
<ul>
  <li>Shump</li>
  <li>Doddle Jump Clone</li>
  <li>Tile Based Zombie Game</li>
  <li>Platformer SpeedRun Game</li>
  <li>Chess</li>
</ul>
Each all run on the 'main.py', except the Doddle Jump Clone (runs on 'app.py', NOT 'main.py').
